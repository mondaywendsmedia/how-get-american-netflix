                <blockquote><p><strong>How to Get American Netflix in New Zealand Today
</strong></p><p><strong>Watching premium TV shows is starting to get quite expensive in New Zealand. This is due to the upsurge in the number of individual pay channels. New Zealand’s networks have to pay more money to TV shows that are already done airing in other countries.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>With an increasing percentage of the population preferring on-demand TV, there is no reason to restrict oneself to what the mainstream channels air.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Netflix is an excellent online streaming service that lets you enjoy on-demand content from its humungous library.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Therefore, with its launch in Australia and New Zealand last year, it should be cause for a celebration for us Kiwis, only there’s a catch – Netflix NZ content lags far behind in terms of both quality and quantity, compared to Netflix USA, the original version of Netflix which has the most extensive library of all Netflix regions.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In other words, Netflix US is still the best choice for New Zealanders looking for premium quality on-demand TV.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Netflix in New Zealand – How to get more content?
</strong></p><p><strong>With its incredibly low starting cost of around $10 a month, Netflix US is a bargain. It used to be the only option until a year ago when Netflix decided to enter Australia and New Zealand officially. Since then, many people have been torn between which versions of the popular streaming service to go for.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Well, we can tell you first hand that the US version is the way to go with its collection of exclusives such as House of Cards, its selection of old and new movies, etc. So what’s stopping us, one might wonder?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The answer is a geo-restriction enforced by Netflix to ensure that only people residing inside a region can subscribe to the service. In our case, we can’t sign up for a Netflix America account because we’re in New Zealand.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Fortunately, where there’s a will, there’s a way. You can access Netflix and sign up for and enjoy US Netflix using the method described below, and even though it isn’t illegal, be warned that Netflix may frown on it. Still, thousands of Kiwis are employing this method to stream movies and TV shows and watch Netflix US without a hitch or legal implication, so you need not worry much. After all, you are paying them for the subscription just like everyone else.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>To bypass the geo-lock enforced by Netflix, you must make them believe that you are actually inside the US, while you are sitting on your couch in NZ! Until recently, the only way to do this was to use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which would give your device a US IP address that would fool Netflix into thinking you were a US resident. This method was slow and time-consuming.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Thanks to new developments in technology, however, there is an easier way – Smart DNS technology. DNS servers convert the name of a website, e.g. www.xyz.com to a number (e.g., 345.321.31.45) that is the actual address for the website.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>New technology enables the smart DNS service provider to make certain traffic appear to be from another country entirely. In simple terms, you will be able to access Netflix.com as if you were in the US, without having to change your actual IP address, so you could go about accessing other websites and services as usual.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>It would only affect the websites from which you would be performing TV shows and movie streaming.</strong></p><p><strong>
